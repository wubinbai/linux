Course Description

This course will introduce students to the basics of Operating Systems, the use of Linux/Unix operating system and the Bash shell. This course will also expose students to the programming language python. Most of the content taught in this course will be done at the command line on a Linux computer. The command line is harder to use than the graphical user interfaces we are used to. But the command line is more powerful and gives us full access to all the features of the operating system.
